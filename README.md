### INTRODUCTION
Wrap-Images is a library, a tool that is going to help the programmers their work. The result of this library is an effect (it can be a hover, mouseover, etc) that acts whenever the cursor of the mouse is over the image. When this happens it's going to appear the alt text that the user decides over the image.
